##### Configuration
---

* Pydio is located at the endpoint `/pydio/`, with configurations
  at `/config/pydio/` and data at `/data`.

* Pydio source is located at `/opt/pydio/pydio.zip`.

* These configurations are inherited from the nginx image:

    * Drop privileges to `alpine` whenever configured to. Respects
      `PUID` / `PGID`.

    * Binds to both http(80) and https(443). Publish whichever you
      need, or both.

    * Default configs setup a static site at `/` by copying
      `/defaults/index.html` at the webroot location
      `/config/www/`.  Mount the `/config/` locally to persist
      modifications (or your webapps). NGINX configs are at
      `/config/nginx`, and vhosts at `/config/nginx/site-confs/`.

    * 4096bit Self-signed SSL certificate is generated in first
      run at `/config/keys`. Pass the runtime variable
      `SSLSUBJECT` with a valid info string to make your own.

    * `.htpasswd` is generated with default credentials
      `admin/insecurebydefault` at `/config/keys/.htpasswd`

    * Sets up a https and auth protected web location at `/secure`.

    * If you're proxying multiple containers at the same host, or
      reverse proxying multiple hosts at the same container, you
      may need to add `--net=host` and/or add entries in your
      firewall to allow traffic.
