This [image][155] serves as the base container for running
a [Buildbot][1] **worker** instance to execute build-steps as
defined in the master. Also, checkout the {{
m.myimage('alpine-buildmaster') }} image for running a master
service.

{{ m.srcimage('alpine-python3') }} with the {{
m.pypipkg('buildbot-worker',
repo='https://github.com/buildbot/buildbot') }} package(s)
installed in it.

#### Run
---

Running the container starts the service.

``` sh
docker run --rm \
  --name docker_buildworker \
  -e BUILDBOT_MASTERADDRESS=your.buildmaster.local`#(1)` \
  -e BUILDBOT_WORKERNAME=buildbot-worker`#(2)` \
  -e BUILDBOT_WORKERPASS=insecurebydefault`#(3)` \
  -v $PWD/buildworker`#(4)`:/home/alpine/buildbot \
woahbase/alpine-buildworker
```

1. (Required) Address of the master node. (Port defaults to 9989)
2. (Required) Name of the worker node.
3. (Required) Password of the worker node.
4. (Optional) Path to your buildbot worker configurations root directory, if you need it to persist.

##### Configuration
---

We can customize the runtime behaviour of the container with the
following environment variables.

Also,

* The env variable `${BUILDBOT_ROLE}` determines if you are running
  a master or worker. This also determines what image you'll be
  running when used with the `makefile`. This is baked into the
  image so does not need to be changed unless you know what you're
  doing.

* Setup tasks are only run when the `buildbot.tac` file does not
  exist or `${BUILDBOT_SKIP_SETUP}` is not set. Same goes for
  arguments / environment variables specific to setup, they are
  not needed anymore after setup is complete.

* {{ m.customscript('p22-buildbot-customize', ghrepo=ghrepo) }}

* The service **does not** run `buildbot-worker`, instead calls
  `twistd` directly, pass `${BUILDBOT_ARGS}` accordingly.

* Mount the configurations at the `${BUILDBOT_HOME}` directory inside
  the container, by default it is `/home/alpine/buildbot`. This is
  optional for workers, however make sure you have enough cpu
  power and memory for the workers to do the heavy lifting if
  required.
