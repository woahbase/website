search/scrape/track torrent (magnet and/or file) links from
a multitude of [supported tracker][4] sites as requested by quite
a few supported apps.

installed in it. {{ m.ghreleasestr('Jackett/Jackett') }}

##### Configuration
---

We can customize the runtime behaviour of the container with the
following environment variables.

| ENV Vars             | Default                 | Description
| :---                 | :---                    | :---
| XDG_CONFIG_HOME      | /config                 | (Preset) Configuration directory for `jackett`.
| XDG_DATA_HOME        | /config                 | (Preset) Data directory for `jackett`.
| JACKETT_LN_LOGTXT    | unset                   | If set to `true`, links the logfile `XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Jackett/log.txt` to a different device (or file) mostly to suppress the output, or optionally redirect it. When `false`, removes the link if it exists.
| JACKETT_LN_LOGDST    | /dev/null               | Links the logfile to this device (or file) when `JACKETT_LN_LOGTXT` is `true`.
| JACKETT_SKIP_PERMFIX | unset                   | If set, skips applying permission fixes to `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and `/torrents`.
| JACKETT_EXEC         | jackett                 | Customizable executable passed to `jackett` service. Can also be `jackett_launcher.sh` if needed.
| JACKETT_ARGS         | --NoRestart --NoUpdates | Customizable arguments passed to `jackett` service.

Also,

* We can set the `BasePathOverride` to `/jackett` (in
  `/config/Jackett/ServerConfig.json`) so it plays well with
  already existing reverse-proxy domain configurations without the
  need to setup another subdomain and separate (or wildcard) set
  of certificates.

* Optionally if your downloader has `watch-dir` capability, we
  can set the `BlackholeDir` to `/torrents`, then sharing this
  directory between the two allows for automatic pickup of magnet
  links by the downloader when it is saved in this directory by
  `jackett`.

* Check the [API][3] for query syntax for custom tracker
  applications.

* Check their [wiki][2] for customizing your own.

* To use `transmission` as your downloader, check the {{
  m.myimage('alpine-transmission') }} image.
