This [image][155] serves as the base container for running
a [Buildbot][1] **master** instance to build applications, run
periodic tasks, and other automations. Checkout their [docs][2]
for configurations or task definitions. Also, checkout the {{
m.myimage('alpine-buildworker') }} image for running
a standalone worker as a service.

{{ m.srcimage('alpine-python3') }} with the {{
m.pypipkg('buildbot',
repo='https://github.com/buildbot/buildbot') }} package(s)
installed in it.

Run
---

Running the container starts the service.

``` sh
docker run --rm \
  --name docker_buildmaster \
  -c 256 -m 256m \
  -p 8010:8010 \
  -p 9989:9989 \
  -p 9990:9990 \
  -p 9991:9991 \
  -v $PWD/buildmaster`#(1)`:/home/alpine/buildbot \
woahbase/alpine-buildmaster
```

1. (Required) Path to your buildbot master configurations root directory.

##### Configuration
---

We can customize the runtime behaviour of the container with the
following environment variables.

| ENV Vars                    | Default                                             | Description

| BUILDBOT_LOGDEST            | stdout                                              | Used in the custom tacfile to determine where logs are sent, can be either of `stdout` (default), `syslog`, or `file`.
| BUILDBOT_LOGROTATE_LENGTH   | 5000                                                | Used in the custom tacfile to determine maximum lines-in-logfile before it is rotated.
| BUILDBOT_LOGROTATE_MAXFILES | 2                                                   | Used in the custom tacfile to determine maximum rotated logfiles that are kept in storage.

| BUILDBOT_CONFIG_TMP         | ${BUILDBOT_HOME}/.tmp                               | Configurations fetched from remote location are temporarily stored in this directory. (Useful if `/tmp` is non-writable or limited space)

| BUILDBOT_WORKERPASS         | insecurebydefault                                   | Password of the default worker updated in `master.cfg`. (Only when using the sample configurations)

Also,

* The env variable `BUILDBOT_ROLE` determines if you are running
  a master or worker. This also determines what image you'll be
  running when used with the `makefile`. It is baked into the
  image so does not need to be changed unless you know what you're
  doing.

* Setup tasks are only run when the `buildbot.tac` file does not
  exist or `BUILDBOT_SKIP_SETUP` is not set. Same goes for
  arguments / environment variables specific to setup, they are
  not needed anymore after setup is complete.

* However, if `BUILDBOT_MASTERCFG` is defined, it will always be
  copied into project before starting the service. This is useful
  for large projects that maintain the configurations separately
  from master configurations.

* {{ m.customscript('p22-buildbot-customize', ghrepo=ghrepo) }}

* The service **does not** run `buildbot` for master, instead calls
  `twistd` directly, pass `BUILDBOT_ARGS` accordingly.

* For the master node, mount the configurations at the
  `BUILDBOT_HOME` directory inside the container, by default it is
  `/home/alpine/buildbot`.
