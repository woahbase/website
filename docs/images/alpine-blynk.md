This [image][155] containerizes [Blynk][1] IOT server,
a platform for visualizing/controlling microcontrollers like
Arduino, RaspberryPi etc that use their [library][3], over the
web, running under [OpenJDK-8][2].

{{ m.srcimage('alpine-openjdk8') }} with the blynk-server [jar][4]
installed in it. {{ m.ghreleasestr('blynkkk/blynk-server') }}

##### Configuration
---

* Blynk home is at `/opt/blynk`.

* User data is at `/opt/blynk/data`. Mount this directory in local
  to persist blynk configuration data.

* Default configurations for server and mail is provided right
  inside the Blynk home directory as `/opt/blynk/server.properties` and
  `/opt/blynk/mail.properties`. Edit or remount these files to use
  custom configurations.

* By default, Blynk binds to the following ports :

    * 7443: Administration UI HTTPS port
    * 8080: HTTP port
    * 8081: Web socket ssl/tls port
    * 8082: Web sockets plain tcp/ip port
    * 8441: Hardware ssl/tls port (for hardware that supports SSL/TLS sockets)
    * 8442: Hardware plain tcp/ip port
    * 8443: Application mutual ssl/tls port
    * 9443: HTTPS port

* This image already has a user `alpine` configured to drop
  privileges to the passed `PUID`/`PGID` which is ideal if its
  used to run in non-root mode. That way you only need to specify
  the values at runtime. (run `id` in your terminal to see your
  own `PUID`/`PGID` values.)
