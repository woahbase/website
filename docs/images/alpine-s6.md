{% import "macros.md" as m with context %}
{% include "shields.md" %}

This [image][155] serves as a base image for applications
/ services that need an init system to launch the process(es) and
pass the proper signals when interacted with the containers.

{{ m.srcimage('alpine-base') }} with the [s6][1] init system
[overlayed][2] on it. {{ m.ghreleasestr('just-containers/s6-overlay') }}

{% include "pull-image.md" %}

---
Run
---

Run `bash` in the container to get a shell, or switch the
entrypoint to `/usershell` to get a [user-scoped][114] shell.

=== "shell"
    ``` sh
    docker run --rm --name docker_s6 woahbase/alpine-s6 /bin/bash
    ```
=== "user-scoped shell"
    ``` sh
    docker run --rm -it --name docker_s6 --entrypoint /usershell woahbase/alpine-s6 /bin/bash
    ```

##### Configuration
---

We can customize the runtime behaviour of the container with the
following environment variables.

| ENV Vars          | Default         | Description
| :---              | :---            | :---
{% include "envvars/alpine-s6.md" %}
| S6_USERGROUPS     | empty string    | **Comma**-separated list of groups to add `${S6_USER}` to. E.g. `"audio,video,tty"`, groups **must** exist.
| S6_USERPASS       | unset           | Password for `${S6_USER}`.
| FILEURL_`varname` | unset           | If set to `<url>|<optional /file/path>`, will download `url` to `/file/path`. See [URL to File](#url-to-file). {{ m.sincev('3.2.1.0') }}
| HGID_`groupname`  | unset           | Update (or create) `groupname` with **non-zero positive integer** `gid` (to match with host). E.g `HGID_VIDEO=995` will change (or create if not exists) `gid` of `video` group to `995`. {{ m.sincev('3.2.0.0') }}
| SECRET__`varname` | unset           | If set to a filepath, the contents of file are loaded in the environment variable `varname` (Note the **double** underscores). See [Secrets](#secrets).
| TRUSTED_CERTS     | unset           | **Space**-or-**comma**-separated certificate files, those are merged into the root (or `nssdb`) certificate store. See [Custom Certificates](#custom-certificates). {{ m.sincev('3.2.1.0_20250516') }}
| TRUSTED_SITES     | unset           | **Space**-or-**comma**-separated server names, the certificates are fetched are merged into the root (or `nssdb`) certificate store. See [Custom Certificates](#custom-certificates). {{ m.sincev('3.2.1.0_20250516') }}

But wait!! There's more...

###### Secrets

To use [docker-secrets][3] that are available inside the container
as pre-exported environment variables, we can specify the variable
as `SECRET__variablename` with the path to the secret-file set
as the value, and at runtime the {{
m.ghfilelink('root/etc/s6-overlay/s6-rc.d/p01-file2env/run',
title='helper-script') }} should read and export the secret as
the value of `variablename`. These environment variables are
available to any scope that uses container-env (`with-contenv`).

###### Custom Certificates

To install and trust your own certificates into the container,
whether obtained from a third party or especially when
self-signed, we can use the {{
m.ghfilelink('root/etc/s6-overlay/s6-rc.d/p04-certup/run',
title='helper-script') }} {{ m.sincev('3.2.1.0_20250516') }} to merge the
certificate files listed in `TRUSTED_CERTS` environment variable
(or fetch those from servers listed in `TRUSTED_SITES` using
{{ m.alpinepkg('openssl') }}) into the root certificate store
(requires {{ m.alpinepkg('ca-certificates') }}), or any `nssdb`
database (requires {{ m.alpinepkg('nssdb-tools') }} for
`certutil` / `pk12util`).

??? info "Custom Certificate defaults and examples"

    These environment variable control how the custom certificates are
    updated into the store.

    | ENV Vars                | Default                          | Description
    | :---                    | :---                             | :---
    | S6_CERTDIR              | /usr/local/share/certificates    | Directory where the certificates are copied or downloaded.
    | S6_CACERTDIR            | /usr/local/share/ca-certificates | (Preset) Directory where the CA certificates are (checked and if success) moved into, before merge. This ensures we don't end up adding non-CA certificates in the root certificate store.
    | S6_CACERT_INCLUDE_NONCA | unset                            | Set to `true` to enable including **non-ca**-certificate files into root certificate store. Rather **insecure**, but gets rid of most `unable to get local issuer certificate` errors during develop/test. Use with **caution**, definitely **not in production** and only with certificates that you *really* trust, but *for some odd reason cannot provide the issuer-CA-Cert for them*, or have signed them yourself.
    | S6_CERTUPDATE           | unset                            | Enabled when atleast one certificate is located, set to `1` to force-refresh the store.
    | NSS_DBDIR               | unset                            | Path to `nssdb` database dir. E.g. `/home/alpine/.pki/nssdb` or `/etc/pki/nssdb`. **Required** for nss-specific tasks to run.
    | NSS_DEFAULT_DB_TYPE     | sql                              | Format of `nssdb`, legacy ones used to be `dbm`.
    | NSS_DBDIR_OWNER         | unset                            | To apply ownership to the database, set it to e.g. `root:root`, if unset, but the path in inside `${S6_USER}`-homedir, it defaults to `alpine:${PGID}`.
    | NSS_TRUST               | P,P,,                            | Default trust for server certificates when installing in `nssdb`.
    | NSS_CATRUST             | CT,C,C,                          | Default trust for CA certificates when installing in `nssdb`.

    The environment variables `TRUSTED_CERTS` and `TRUSTED_SITES`
    are **space**-or-**comma**-separated lists of file (or
    directory) path and `server[:port-optional]` (port defaults to
    `443`) addresses respectively. E.g.
    ```
    TRUSTED_CERTS="/crts/cert1.ca.crt /crts/cert2.crt /crts/cert3.pfx"
    ```
    ```
    TRUSTED_SITES="example.com test.net:443 hello.world.local:64801"
    ```

The required packages *may* or **may not** be installed
depending on the image, for the latter, they can be installed
at runtime by adding them in the `S6_NEEDED_PACKAGES`
variable. Recommended to preserve-and-remount the certificate
stores for subsequent runs to reduce the mutable surface area.

###### URL to File

To fetch a file (or a `.tar.gz` archive) from your local
file-server (or any public URL) into the container, use the
environment variable `FILEURL_variablename`
{{ m.ghfilelink('root/etc/s6-overlay/s6-rc.d/p03-wgetfile/run',
title='helper-script') }} {{ m.sincev('3.2.1.0') }}. This will
fetch the file from the specified URL, optionally put the file
in specified filepath (in `/defaults` if not specified). If
the URL points to a `.tar.gz` archive, it is unpacked in the
specified directory.

??? info "URL-to-File defaults and few examples"

    These environment variable control how the file is downloaded
    and unpacked.

    | ENV Vars                   | Default         | Description
    | :---                       | :---            | :---
    | S6_FILEURL_DEFDIR          | /defaults/      | Default directory where the file is downloaded/unpacked when no filepath is specified.
    | S6_FILEURL_DEFOWNER        | root:root       | Default owner/group for a downloaded file. **Does not** apply to unpacked archives by default, set `S6_FILEURL_FIXOWNER_UNPACK` to a non-empty string e.g. `1` to enable for unpacked archives.
    | S6_FILEURL_DEFPERMS        | 0644            | Default permissions for a downloaded file. **Does not** apply to unpacked archives.
    | S6_FILEURL_DELIMITER       | `|`             | Delimiter to separate the `url` and `/file/path`.
    | S6_FILEURL_RETRIES         | 5               | Number of retries for fetching a file, sleeps `5` seconds between retries.
    | S6_FILEURL_STRIPCOMPONENTS | 0               | For stripping directories when unpacking a downloaded archive.
    | S6_FILEURL_TMPDIR          | /tmp/           | Directory where the temporary file is downloaded before moving into proper place.

    For example,

    | Value of FILEURL_(variablename)            | Action
    | :---                                       | :---
    | `https://test.site/a.txt`                  | Get `a.txt` in `/defaults`.
    | `https://test.site/a.txt|/srv/`            | Get `a.txt` in `/srv`.
    | `https://test.site/a.txt|/srv/b.txt`       | Get `a.txt` contents in `/srv/b.txt`.
    | `https://test.site/c.tar.gz`               | Get and unpack `c.tar.gz` in `/defaults`.
    | `https://test.site/c.tar.gz|/srv/`         | Get and unpack `c.tar.gz` in `/srv`.
    | `https://test.site/c.tar.gz|/srv/d.tar.gz` | Get `c.tar.gz` as `/srv/d.tar.gz` but **don't** unpack it.

There are **some limitations**, it uses busybox `wget` so
authentications are not supported (although retries are) so use it
with a hint of caution, and it only supports unpacking for
`.tar.gz` archives. The variable-name has no effect at the moment,
but for the value, remember to specify only **full-paths** (beginning
with a `/`) for filepaths, and end with a `/` to distinguish
between files and directories.

###### Usershell

Docker images by default, do not provide a easy way to dynamically
drop privileges to a user before executing `CMD` definitions, it
is not always feasible to hardcode those in the `Dockerfile` and
it becomes more complex with the additional initialization stages
that `s6` introduces. To ease this problem, in addition to the
`/init` entrypoint script that s6 brings, another {{
m.ghfilelink('root/usershell', title='alternate init-script') }}
is added at `/usershell` that run the initialization stage tasks
**as root**, and then execute the `CMD` **as a not-root
user**. This way, images that set their entrypoint to
`/usershell` have all the benefits of s6, but the CMD that is
run, is run by `${S6_USER}` (by default `alpine`). Checkout any of
the images tagged [usershell][4] for an example.
