##### Configuration
---

* Wildfly runs under the user `alpine`, which is ideal to run in
  non-root mode.

* Default administration credentials are : `admin` : `insecurebydefault`.

* For standalone usage, only needed to mount the `deployments`
  directory with the WAR/JAR files, optionally `standalone.xml` if
  there are specifications. For the latter and if additional libs
  are needed, rebind the `lib` directory as well.

* the `SERVERCONFIG` environment variable which configuration to
  use inside the configuration directory, the `USERNAME` and the
  `PASSWORD` environment variables specify the default
  administrator credentials.
