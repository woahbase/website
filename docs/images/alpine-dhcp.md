This [image][155] containerizes the [ISC DHCP][1] to quickly
deploy a DHCP server to serve/manage IP configurations to the
devices in the network.

{{ m.srcimage('alpine-s6') }} with the {{ m.alpinepkg('dhcp', branch='v3.20') }}
package installed in it.

???+ warning "DHCP deprecated since v3.21"

    `dhcp` packages are unavailable in Alpine Linux Repositories since
    `v3.21`. This image uses the final pre-built packages (`4.4.3-p1`) from
    the `v3.20` repository.

Run
---

Running the container starts the service.

``` sh
docker run --rm \
  --name docker_dhcp \
  --network=host \
  -e INTERFACES=eth0 \
  -p 67:67/tcp -p 67:67/udp \
  -v $PWD/dhcp:/etc/dhcp \
woahbase/alpine-dhcp
```

##### Configuration
---

We can customize the runtime behaviour of the container with the
following environment variables.

| ENV Vars    | Default                    | Description
| :---        | :---                       | :---
| DHCP_CONF   | /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf       | Path to configuration file.
| DHCP_LEASES | /var/lib/dhcp/dhcpd.leases | Path to lease(s) database.
| DHCP_ARGS   | -4 -f -d --no-pid          | Customizable arguments passed to `dhcpd` service.
| INTERFACES  | eth0                       | Bind to the specific NIC.

Also,

* ISC-DHCP needs the `--network=host` flag to have access to the
  NIC of the host machine.

* {{ m.defcfgfile('/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf', vname='DHCP_CONF') }}

* Check the [docs][2] or [configuration][3] options for
  customizing your own.

##### DHCP Failover

For failover, consider configuring two servers (namely `primary` and
`secondary`) like the following.

=== "primary"

    ``` conf
    failover peer "dhcp-failover" {
      primary;
      address 172.17.0.39; # Primary DHCP Server IP
      port 647; # Primary DHCP Server port
      peer address 172.17.0.67; # Secondary DHCP Server IP
      peer port 847; # Secondary DHCP Server port
      mclt 120;
      split 128;
      load balance max seconds 5;
      max-response-delay 15;
      max-unacked-updates 10;
    }

    # optionally include shared configurations from another file
    # include "/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.shared.conf";

    subnet 172.17.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
      # your subnet specific configurations
      pool {
        failover peer "dhcp-failover";
        # your pool specific parameters
      };
    };
    ```

=== "secondary"

    ``` conf
    failover peer "dhcp-failover" {
      secondary;
      address 172.17.0.67; # Secondary DHCP Server IP
      port 847; # Secondary DHCP Server port
      peer address 172.17.0.39; # Primary DHCP Server IP
      peer port 647; # Primary DHCP Server port
      max-response-delay 15;
      max-unacked-updates 10;
      load balance max seconds 5;
    }

    # optionally include shared configurations from another file
    # include "/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.shared.conf";

    subnet 172.17.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
      # your subnet specific configurations
      pool {
        failover peer "dhcp-failover";
        # your pool specific parameters
      };
    };
    ```

##### DHCP Hooks

For running a hook-script when an event takes place, consider the
following (references [here][6] and [here][7])

``` conf
subnet 172.17.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
  # your subnet specific configurations

  # event can be one of commit | expiry | release e.g.
  on commit {
    set chw = binary-to-ascii(16, 8, ":", substring(hardware, 1, 6));
    set cip = binary-to-ascii(10, 8, ".", leased-address);
    set cnm = pick-first-value(host-decl-name, option fqdn.hostname, option host-name, "unknown");
    execute("/bin/dhcp_on_event", "commit", chw, cip, cnm);
  }
  on expiry {
    set chw = binary-to-ascii(16, 8, ":", substring(hardware, 1, 6));
    set cip = binary-to-ascii(10, 8, ".", leased-address);
    set cnm = pick-first-value(host-decl-name, option fqdn.hostname, option host-name, "unknown");
    execute("/bin/dhcp_on_event", "expiry", chw, cip, cnm);
  }
  on release {
    set chw = binary-to-ascii(16, 8, ":", substring(hardware, 1, 6));
    set cip = binary-to-ascii(10, 8, ".", leased-address);
    set cnm = pick-first-value(host-decl-name, option fqdn.hostname, option host-name, "unknown");
    execute("/bin/dhcp_on_event", "release", chw, cip, cnm);
  }
}
```

and the script can be like

``` sh
#!/bin/bash

EVNT="${1:? \$1 event type is required}";
CHW="${2:? \$2 client-MAC is required}";
CIP="${3:? \$3 client-ip is required}";
CNM="${4:? \$4 client-hostname is required}";

echo "Detected event ${EVNT} for host ${CNM} with address ${CIP} (mac ${CHW})";

# now do whatever is needed,
# keep in mind the script should return as soon as possible
