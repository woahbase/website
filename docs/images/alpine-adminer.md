##### Configuration
---

We can customize the runtime behaviour of the container with the
following environment variables.

| ENV Vars            | Default           | Description
| :---                | :---              | :---
| CSSURL              | (default-css-url) | If set to a custom css url, overrides the default theme.
| ADMINER_SKIP_EDITOR | unset             | Set to `true` if you don't need editor functionality.

Also,

* Adminer is located at the endpoint `/adminer/`, and the editor
  at `/editor`.  The latter is provided as is so little setup may
  be required to set proper authentication and access. The scripts
  are located in `/config/www/adminer/`, mount this in your local
  for any customizations.

* Includes everything from the {{ m.myimage('alpine-php') }} image.

* Which in turn, includes everything from the {{ m.myimage('alpine-nginx') }} image.

* Which in turn, includes everything from the {{ m.myimage('alpine-s6') }} image.
