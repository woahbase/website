We can call `python` directly on the container, or run `bash` in
the container to get a shell,

=== "command"
    ``` sh
    docker run --rm -it --name docker_python2 woahbase/alpine-python2:x86_64 python -V
    ```
=== "shell"
    ``` sh
    docker run --rm -it --name docker_python2 woahbase/alpine-python2:x86_64 /bin/bash
    ```
