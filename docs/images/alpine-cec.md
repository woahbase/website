This [image][155] containerizes the [LibCEC][1] client binaries to
control supported TV/displays (connected via HDMI) using the
[CLI][3] or remotely via telnet with [PyCEC][4].

{{ m.srcimage('alpine-s6') }} with the compiled [platform][7] and
[LibCEC][2] binaries and the packages {{ m.pypipkg('PyCEC') }} and
{{ m.alpinepkg('v4l-utils') }} installed in it.
{{ m.ghreleasestr('Pulse-Eight/libcec') }}

Run
---

Running the container starts the service.

``` sh
docker run --rm \
  --name docker_cec \
  -e GID_DIALOUT=994 `#(1)` \
  -e GID_VIDEO=995 `#(2)` \
  -p 9526:9526 \
woahbase/alpine-cec
```

1. (Optional) Set GID_DIALOUT to the GID of the group `dialout` on the host, to allow processes
    running inside docker (as user `alpine`) access to cec-enabled
    devices. To find yours, run
    ```
    getent group dialout | awk -F ":" '{ print $3 }'
    ```

2. Set GID_VIDEO to the GID of the group `video` on the host, to allow processes
    running inside docker (as user `alpine`) access to cec-enabled
    devices. To find yours, run
    ```
    getent group video | awk -F ":" '{ print $3 }'
    ```

##### Configuration
---

We can customize the runtime behaviour of the container with the
following environment variables.

| ENV Vars                 | Default      | Description
| :---                     | :---         | :---
| GID_DIALOUT              | unset        | Group-id of `dialout` group on the host. If set, updates group-id of the group `dialout` inside container, and adds `S6_USER` to the group.
| GID_VIDEO                | unset        | Group-id of `video` group on the host. If set, updates group-id of the group `video` inside container, and adds `S6_USER` to the group.
| PYCEC_HOST               | 0.0.0.0      | Host address for `pycec` service to listen on.
| PYCEC_PORT               | 9526         | Port for `pycec` service.
| PYCEC_ARGS               | -i $PYCEC_HOST -p $PYCEC_PORT | Customizable arguments passed to `pycec` service.
| WAIT_FOR_HDMI_CONNECT    | unset        | If set to `true`, will wait for HDMI connection to become available, before starting `pycec` service.
| WAIT_SEC                 | 10           | Poll interval for checking if HDMI is connected.

Also,

* For example, to scan the CEC bus to figure connected device
  addresses (running on a Raspberry Pi, requires
  a [user-scoped shell](#shell-access) inside the container)
  ``` sh
  echo "scan" | cec-client RPI -s -d 1
  ```
  Control TV power on/off locally with,
  ``` sh
  # power on
  echo "on 0" | cec-client RPI -s -d 1
  # or
  echo "tx 10:04" | cec-client RPI -s -d 4

  # power off
  echo "standby 0" | cec-client RPI -s -d 1
  # or
  echo "tx 10:36" | cec-client RPI -s -d 4
  ```
  Or remotely via telnet using `nc`,
  ``` sh
  # power on
  echo -e "10:04" | nc -w1 -i1 cec-host.local 9526

  # power off
  echo -e "10:36" | nc -w1 -i1 cec-host.local 9526
  ```

  commands, or depending on what features are supported on your
  TV, find/decode your own with [cec-o-matic][6].
