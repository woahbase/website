This [image][155] serves as the base image for applications
/ services that require an [OpenJDK7][1] compiler/runtime.

{{ m.srcimage('alpine-glibc') }} with the {{
m.alpinepkg('openjdk7', star=true, branch='v3.18') }} packages
installed in it.

???+ warning "JDK 7 Deprecation"

    OpenJDK `7.*.*` prebuilt packages has been excluded from
    Alpine Linux Repositories since `v3.19`. This image uses the
    packages from the `v3.18` repo.
