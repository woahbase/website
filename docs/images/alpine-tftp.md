This [image][155] containerizes [Trivial FTP][1] daemon, providing
a primitive but reliable file-access service intended to
network-boot (or PXE) hosts. Checkout {{ m.myimage('alpine-nfs')
}} for post-boot rootfs-serving needs.

{{ m.srcimage('alpine-s6') }} with the {{ m.alpinepkg('tftp-hpa')
}} package installed in it.

Run
---

Running the container starts the service.

``` sh
docker run --rm \
  --name docker_tftp \
  -p 69:69/udp \
  -p 63050-63100/udp \
  -v $PWD/data:/data \
woahbase/alpine-tftp
```

##### Configuration
---

We can customize the runtime behaviour of the container with the
following environment variables.

| ENV Vars   | Default                                      | Description
| :---       | :---                                         | :---
| TFTP_ROOT  | /data                                        | Path to storage directory.
| TFTPD_ARGS | --port-range 63050:63100 --secure $TFTP_ROOT | Customizable arguments passed to `in.tftp` service.

Also,

* Recommended to use a remap-file to add further safety. E.g.
  ```
  rg \\ /      # Convert backslashes to slashes
  r ^[^/] /\0  # Convert non-absolute files
  a ^/private/ # Reject requests for private dir
  a \.pvt$     # Reject requests for private files
  e ^/public/  # Allow access to  public files
  # Add the remote IP address as a folder on the front of all requests.
  # Essentially puts every request under its own IP jail. This way,
  #  Any host can have its own fileset in its own directory by its IP, referenced by /
  #  Only provisioned hosts can boot, other hosts unaffected
  #  HostA cannot get HostB files
  r ^ \i/
  ```

* Checkout the [docs][2] to customize your own.
