# Support Us

First of all, a big **THANK YOU** for

* taking an interest in this project,

* making one or more of our codebases/images a part of your own
  build system, development workflow, or self-hosted ecosystem.

* actually reading this page.

Yep, those honestly are the *real-est* rewards.

However, maintenance, and especially for the container images,
build resources and time are things that are never truly free.
Donating is a great way to show your active participation in our
ongoing endeavour to provide self-hostable and deploy-ready
software to the whole world. With your support, you allow me to
focus on this project and invest more time (then eventually, new
hardware) on it than otherwise. Every little bit helps.
